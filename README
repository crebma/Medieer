Probably a poorly named application since there's already a MediaInfo out there,
but I digress.

The purpose of this application is to take a directory of video files, organize
and generate metadata about them using themoviedb.com and thetvdb.com to flesh
out the information

The APIs are meant to be pluggable, so if you wanted to integrate imdb, tvrage,
etc, it would be relatively easy to do.

Requirements:
Python 2.6 - 2.X

Python libs:
SQLObject
AppDirs
lxml (perhaps replace with BeautifulSoup)
wxpython (for gui)
BeautifulSoup
